# A cool WP-NextJS site

Just a sample Wordpress site that uses a NextJS front-end connected via WP APIs.

Currently using basic WP REST API but will expand to custom API for more capabilities (e.g. authentication)

## Getting Started

**Install a Wordpress site locally, add sample lorem posts, add content and placeholder images**

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### To-do's
- Improve site design starting from the homepage inwards
- Setup custom WP theme to enable expanded API capabilities
- Add dynamic data for logo, menus, etc.
- Setup sample single post/page template
- Setup archive category pages

---

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
